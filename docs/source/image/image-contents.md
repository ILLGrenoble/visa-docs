This section describes the creation and configuration of the virtual machine that runs on the cloud infrastructure as it is done at the ILL. This can be used as an example for other sites to build their own images but their is no obligation to follow this procedure. We aim to provide details on the experience that we have obtained over the last year with the development of images used in a production environment.
