# Alternative Cloud Provider

> **_NOTE_** This documentation is work in progress

This section describes how an alternative to OpenStack as a cloud provider can be integrated into VISA.

Currently only OpenStack is fully supported by VISA. We do however allow middleware to be integrated into the VISA platform to provide communication to other cloud providers.

VISA API Server can be configured to use the *Web Cloud Provider*. The Web Cloud Provider defines uses a well-defined API that can be implemented by a third party to make a connection to an alternative cloud provider.
